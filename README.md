# stm32wl-hal

Embedded rust HAL (hardware abstraction layer) for the STM32WL.

This is a **work in progress**, it is unstable, incomplete, and untested.

**Use at your own risk.**

There should be enough code for very basic:

* LoRa TX
* (G)FSK TX
* ECDSA signing
* ECDSA verification

## Why upload incomplete code?

This has uploaded to github in an incomplete state because this is better than
nothing for other people developing on these new chips.

I am also hoping to find other people using these chips with rust who want to
collaborate on creating a HAL :)
